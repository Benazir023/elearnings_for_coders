Let’s assume that we’re working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. 
Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we’d like to invest some money in advertisement. 
Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

The objectives include: <br />
- summarizing distributions using the mean, the median, and the mode.<br />
- using measures of variability of a distribution using the range, the mean absolute deviation, the variance, and the standard deviation.<br />
- locating any value(s) in a distribution using z-scores.<br />

After comfirming that our sample data was representative enough (of elearners that subscribe to web and mobile development content), we went ahead to find out the locations of most of those coders.

We also tried to analyze how much they spend per month in their subscriptions.

In conclusion, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. 
The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.
For the second best market, it wasn’t clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. 
We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
